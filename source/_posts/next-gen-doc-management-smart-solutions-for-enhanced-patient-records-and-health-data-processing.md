USE CASES Intelligent Document Processing in Healthcare 

Patient registration Patient records Revenue cycle management Referral management Claims and billing Patient surveys Invoice processing Healthcare applications 99% accuracy of critical details captured — FDA 80% straight-through, touchless processing of referrals — Major US non-profit health system 10,000 hours saved per year in manual data entry — Parasol Intelligent Document Processing Use Cases in Healthcare The world’s leading enterprises trust ABBYY Pre-trained document skills with 90% accuracy out of the box 2 

Optimize revenue cycle management with ready-to-use document processing skills Today’s circumstances make it more necessary than ever for healthcare providers to smartly manage revenue, optimize utilization, and reduce costs across their care continuum. Taking long overdue, fundamental steps to embrace digitization and automation of paper-driven processes has become a must. Legacy approaches to document processing involve only basic optical character recognition (OCR), data extraction, validation, and rules-based processing. Intelligent document processing holds much greater potential to improve cost and productivity efficiencies by employing modern, AI-based document processing “skills” to make the information that’s trapped within business documents immediately accessible and actionable. Delivering artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions is not new for ABBYY. We have over 30 years of experience processing tens of billions of pages for customers globally, addressing the real-world challenges of our customers with technology. Our AI and machine learning technologies are highly optimized—for documents, for text, for language, for extraction, for precision, and for consistency. In 2019, ABBYY introduced the industry’s first low-code / no-code intelligent document processing platform to make this technology available in a cloud-based, point-and-click approach to empower citizen developers to easily incorporate IDP into their highly manual or repetitive document-centric processes. ABBYY Vantage provides pre-trained document processing skills in an online marketplace that are ready to use within minutes. Using ABBYY pre-trained document skills, customers are able to start production tomorrow and achieve the highest level out-of-the-box accuracy without the need for OCR and machine learning expertise. Structured Data Unstructured Documents IDP Intelligent document processing (IDP) 3 

USE CASE: PATIENT REGISTRATION accuracy of critical details captured 99%+ Automatically extract data from paper and image-only documents including IDs, insurance cards, forms, referral documents, prescriptions, and surveys Simply scan patient registration documents and let OCR, data capture, and classification technologies read the data Enable patients to use portals and mobile devices to capture data and submit documents themselves Take the manual data entry out of patient registration procedures — U.S. Food and Drug Administration 4 

Integrate paper and images from existing and new patient records into new EHR workflows Capture patient records from scanners, portals, mobile devices, faxes, emails, and MFPs Extract the data required to automatically associate records with the right EHRs, such as patient name, date of birth, etc. USE CASE: PATIENT RECORDS medical records per day converted into electronic health records (EHR) 250,000 Quickly transfer patient data from paper into EHRs — athenahealth 5 

Visualize revenue cycle processes end to end, using data from various systems and sources; automatically understand process execution using point-and-click analysis Gain insight into process vulnerabilities that contribute to revenue leakage; identify opportunities for intelligent document processing Strategically optimize processes to ensure faster, more accurate reimbursements and anticipate future changes USE CASE: REVENUE CYCLE MANAGEMENT in uncompensated care provided by hospitals since 2020 $745 billion Shorten the gap between billing and payment — American Hospital Association 6 

Reduce revenue leakage by automating the processing of referrals received by fax Integrate data from faxes into EHRs automatically, eliminating manual data entry and improving accuracy of data delivered Eliminate referral process latency to improve patient outcomes USE CASE: REFERRAL MANAGEMENT Transform patient referrals into revenue — Major US non-profit health system 80% straight-through, touchless processing 10 minutes saved per referral 7 

Process claims forms more accurately and cost- efficiently with automated data capture, including HCFA/CMS-1500 and UB-04/CMS-1450, as well as claim attachments Use automatic validation rules to ensure that billing, accounting, and healthcare claims management applications receive accurate data Enable distributed scanning and submission of claims via a web browser, in addition to centralized capture USE CASE: CLAIMS AND BILLING submission of CMS-1500 paper forms via EDI with ABBYY IDP 100% Reduce the cost of processing claims — Podiatry Plan 8 

Automate the entire HCAHPS survey processing workflow, from scanning and data extraction to automatic validation and verification of data Eliminate time-consuming and error-prone manual data processing, while ensuring that data is captured and processed in a manner consistent with integrity rules Speed submission of patient survey data to ensure deadlines are met and full CMS reimbursements are collected USE CASE: PATIENT SURVEYS per year in manual data entry time Over 10,000 hours saved Expedite the collection and submission of patient satisfaction surveys — Parasol 9 

Automate the extraction of invoice data, verify the accuracy of charges, and match against vendor terms Reduce manual data entry and its associated costs and errors Accommodate growing invoice volumes while increasing process transparency USE CASE: INVOICE PROCESSING required for invoice processing 50% less time Straight-through processing of invoices in any format or language — Singapore healthcare facility 10
