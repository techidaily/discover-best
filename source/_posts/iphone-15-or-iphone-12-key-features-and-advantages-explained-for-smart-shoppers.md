iPhone 15 vs 13 Design 

## Camera

* iPhone 15 Pro/13 Pro Max: Triple rear, 6x optical zoom range, Night Mode, Cinematic Video mode, Photographic Styles, Macro
* iPhone 15 Pro/12 Pro Mx: Triple rear, 4x/5x optical zoom range, Night Mode

The camera may be where the biggest upgrade is made in iPhone 15\. The cameras of the iPhone 15/13 mini share the same specs as the iPhone 15, except that there is a new sensor to capture up to 47% more light and there is a new sensor-shift OIS. The entirely new camera system on iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max is a good reason to upgrade. Here are the key differences between iPhone 15 Pro/Max and iPhone 15 Pro/Max:

![Should I buy iPhone 15 or iPhone 14](https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/article-image/13-12-camera.jpg) 

iPhone 15 vs iPhone 14 camera

iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max now supports new telephoto, ultra-wide, and wide lenses, with the sensor-shift stabilization, which is available on iPhone 15 Pro only. There is also 3x optical zoom in and 15x digital zoom to record subjects closely without loss of detail. The wider apertures on iPhone 15 improve the low-light performance by "up to 92% improvement in low light" according to Apple. 

The new Cinematic mode allows for a rack focus effect to intelligently shift the focus from one subject to another. Now you can easily create beautiful depth effects and focus transitions with iPhone 15, that's what iPhone 15 can't do. The new Photographic Styles applies local edits to an image in real-time as the photo is rendered. And you can record videos in ProRes in 4K 30fps on the iPhone 15 Pro.
