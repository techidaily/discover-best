Believe it or not, iTunes is absolutely most commonly used tool to transfer music from iPhone to Mac. Yet, iTunes can be a disaster now and then. It's not only complicated in steps, you may also be annoyed with growing problems deriving from iTunes errors and inherent limitations.

* iTunes only allows you to transfer music purchased from iTunes Store, those ripped from CD or downloaded excluded.
* Once you sync your music from iPhone to Mac with iTunes, the original music files on iPhone were erased, leading iTunes library disappeared on your source device. You can't keep them both on iPhone and Mac.
* iTunes 12 or newer is really buggy that users never stop complaining about it for freezing Mac, removing album art, etc.
* Most importantly, iTunes was shut down by Apple now!
