Believe it or not, iTunes is absolutely most commonly used tool to transfer music from iPhone to Mac. Yet, iTunes can be a disaster now and then. It's not only complicated in steps, you may also be annoyed with growing problems deriving from iTunes errors and inherent limitations.

* iTunes only allows you to transfer music purchased from iTunes Store, those ripped from CD or downloaded excluded.
* Once you sync your music from iPhone to Mac with iTunes, the original music files on iPhone were erased, leading iTunes library disappeared on your source device. You can't keep them both on iPhone and Mac.
* iTunes 12 or newer is really buggy that users never stop complaining about it for freezing Mac, removing album art, etc.
* Most importantly, iTunes was shut down by Apple now!

To break these iTunes limits, you need a [top iTunes alternative](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), offering a seamless music transfer from iPhone to Mac.

## Part 5\. How to Copy Music Songs from iPhone to Mac Wirelessly via AirDrop

Now your iPhone music songs are syncing to your MacBook or iMac wirelessly. If you have no Apple music subscription and still need wireless music transfer, you can rely on AirDrop, as well. Be noted that both your iPhone and Mac should use the same Wi-Fi connection and be placed within 40 feet (13m) of each other. And the bluetooth range is supposed to be roughly 30 feet.

**Step 1.** Enable AirDrop on your Mac and iPhone.

* Navigate to the Finder on your Mac > choose AirDrop from the left sidebar > change its visibility to everyone.
* Tap Settings on your iPhone > General > toggle on AirDrop.
