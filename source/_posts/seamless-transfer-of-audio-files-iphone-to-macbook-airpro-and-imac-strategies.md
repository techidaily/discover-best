Believe it or not, iTunes is absolutely most commonly used tool to transfer music from iPhone to Mac. Yet, iTunes can be a disaster now and then. It's not only complicated in steps, you may also be annoyed with growing problems deriving from iTunes errors and inherent limitations.

* iTunes only allows you to transfer music purchased from iTunes Store, those ripped from CD or downloaded excluded.
* Once you sync your music from iPhone to Mac with iTunes, the original music files on iPhone were erased, leading iTunes library disappeared on your source device. You can't keep them both on iPhone and Mac.
* iTunes 12 or newer is really buggy that users never stop complaining about it for freezing Mac, removing album art, etc.
* Most importantly, iTunes was shut down by Apple now!

To break these iTunes limits, you need a [top iTunes alternative](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), offering a seamless music transfer from iPhone to Mac.

* Head to "Settings" on your iPhone > "Music" > toggle on "iCloud Music Library" or "Sync Library."
* Open the Apple Music app on your Mac > choose "Music" > "Preferences." > "General" > select "iCloud Music Library" or "Sync Library" > hit "OK."

Now your iPhone music songs are syncing to your MacBook or iMac wirelessly. If you have no Apple music subscription and still need wireless music transfer, you can rely on AirDrop, as well.

## Part 5\. How to Copy Music Songs from iPhone to Mac Wirelessly via AirDrop

Now your iPhone music songs are syncing to your MacBook or iMac wirelessly. If you have no Apple music subscription and still need wireless music transfer, you can rely on AirDrop, as well. Be noted that both your iPhone and Mac should use the same Wi-Fi connection and be placed within 40 feet (13m) of each other. And the bluetooth range is supposed to be roughly 30 feet.

**Step 1.** Enable AirDrop on your Mac and iPhone.

* Navigate to the Finder on your Mac > choose AirDrop from the left sidebar > change its visibility to everyone.
* Tap Settings on your iPhone > General > toggle on AirDrop.

## Part 6\. How to Move iPhone Music Files to Mac with Cloud Service

 To save iPhone song files to Mac computer, how could you miss the cloud service? Hold on! Does this part introduce iCloud tutorial to backup iPhone photos to Mac? Of course not. 

Here will show you a much better FREE cloud service to download music from iPhone to Mac. That's **Baidu Cloud**. If you have scarcely any acquaintance with this iCloud competitor, you're supposed to get closer to it:

![Copy iPhone music to Mac via cloud service](https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/../mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/baidu-cloud.jpg) 

* Up to **2TB** free storage space for you to upload music, audiobooks, video, photos, app, etc.
* Built-in file viewer to let you view files on iPhone, download, delete and share files.
* No add-ons or adware. Just register and sign in your Baidu account to enjoy these services.

### How to Copy Songs from iPhone to Mac Using iCloud Alternative

**Step 1.** Download and install this free cloud storage application on your iPhone. 

**Step 2.** Register an account or directly sign in with Baidu account if you have one. For the iPhone users, you can instantly get 2TB FREE storage space to save iPhone files once you add a bank card to your account (no need to pay). This will save you $9.99 every month compared with iCloud storage plans.

**Step 3.** Click "Transfer List" to upload iPhone files. And it will automatically backup your photos under Wi-Fi circumstance. 

**Optional:** Click "Share" icon and you can directly share almost any file on your iPhone to your friends.

**Step 4.** Sign into Baidu Cloud on the website on your Mac computer. Next, choose the music file and tap "Download" option to download iPhone music to Mac.

Until now, the whole iPhone music to Mac transfer is finished. Currently, the Baidu Cloud 2TB is free to the public. But I guess it will charge soon or later once its users reach a large quantity. So if this iCloud alternative does make you excited, seize time and chance to give it a try now.
