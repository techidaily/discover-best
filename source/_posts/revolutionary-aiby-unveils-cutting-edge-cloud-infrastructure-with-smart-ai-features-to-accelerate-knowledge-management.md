_ABBYY.cloud provides businesses with natural language processing technology to dramatically increase the speed of document digitization and semantic analysis_

ABBYY®, a leading provider of technologies and solutions to action information, today announced the launch of the [ABBYY.cloud](https://abbyy.cloud/) platform that provides services and solutions in the cloud – capture and transfer of information from paper documents into business applications, accurate content classification and prompt translation in 80 languages. With ABBYY.cloud, organizations can access a wide variety of tools for knowledge processing from a single dashboard.

As the cloud market continues to [accelerate in 2017](http://blogs.forrester.com/dave%5Fbartoletti/16-11-02-forrester%5Fpredictions%5Ften%5Fkey%5Fdevelopments%5Fin%5Fcloud%5Fcomputing%5Fshape%5Fthe%5Findustry%5Fin%5F2017?cm%5Fmmc=RSS-%5F-BT-%5F-65-%5F-blog%5F25945), an increasing number of organizations are also moving workloads to the cloud in a big way. According to Forrester’s Dave Bartoletti, enterprises need to take a fresh look at industry-specific cloud providers with specialization and get their cloud strategies in shape.

ABBYY.cloud is designed to help such enterprises process, digitize and extract data from a wide variety of sources including images, text and invoices. Furthermore, ABBYY.cloud customers can leverage both automated and professional human services from ABBYY.

“The world is becoming increasingly digital and dependent on continuous data exchange. This puts extreme pressure on organizations to grow globally and scale their processes faster,” said Anton Voronov, ABBYY.cloud CEO. “Before, an engineer used to require a month in order to obtain all the approvals and start to improve knowledge processing efficiency within a company. Now he can simply log into his ABBYY.cloud account and ten minutes later start working on his project.”

Beginning in 2017, the platform will leverage [ABBYY’s Compreno technology](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), a natural language processing (NLP) Artificial Intelligence (AI) parser. Compreno will leverage proprietary NLP technology to interpret the meaning of texts and the relationships between them throughout the document, thus providing the ability to analyze and compare corporate data with artificial intelligence capabilities. This equips the knowledge workers to quickly and easily uncover insights and trends from unstructured text.

For example, ABBYY.cloud helps companies to work with customer feedback, which is essential source for strategic decision making. When customers send their feedback to a company, they use their own idiosyncratic words and logic. A single message may include several different issues in an unorganized fashion. NLP technology understands the meaning of text the same way humans do — resulting in outstandingly accurate document classification.

“The result of 17-years of R&D efforts in AI, NLP and semantics of 700 ABBYY engineers and scientists is now available from one single place at ABBYY.cloud. If any engineer at any company needs an AI technology that emulates the human reading process and analyses massive troves of user-generated data, he or she can get such AI technology in 10 minutes at ABBYY.cloud and can build his/her prototype product ‘by next Monday,’” says David Yang, ABBYY Founder.

ABBYY.cloud’s technology and services will be offered on a consumption-based pricing model where customers are charged per the amount of services they consume. Document conversion (from PDF and JPG to any format), invoice processing and translation solutions are now available for testing by enterprises, SMBs, developers and individual consumers via a web portal and open API.
