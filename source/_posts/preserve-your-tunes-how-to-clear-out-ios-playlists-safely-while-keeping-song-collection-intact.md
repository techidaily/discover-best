### #1 How to Delete a Playlist on iPhone 

Removing one playlist at a time is simple on iPhones running iOS 17 or later. Deleting playlists won't affect the songs stored on iPhone. Before you start, make sure you have downloaded all the songs you want to store on your iPhone. Undownloaded songs will be removed from iTunes library when you delete the playlist from iPhone. To save the songs to the library, go to Settings and tap Music, then toggle on the button Add Playlist Songs.

1\. Open the Music app on iPhone and select Playlists at the top. Here are all your playlists, go to the playlist you want to delete.  
 2\. Next, tap the playlist and you will see a red circle button with three dots in it (…) near the top-right corner of the screen. Tap it.  
 3\. Next, tap Delete from Library button from the menu and then Delete Playlist. If the songs are saved on your iPhone, you'll still be able to access the songs when the playlist is deleted from iPhone music library.
