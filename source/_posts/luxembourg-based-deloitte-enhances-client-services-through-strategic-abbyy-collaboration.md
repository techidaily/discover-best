Deloitte Luxembourg and intelligent automation company ABBYY have entered into a [partnership](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) that will help their clients accelerate business processes and increase profitability. The company will offer ABBYY’s intelligent document processing (IDP) solution to clients bringing together the best NLP, machine learning, and advanced recognition capabilities.

ABBYY offers the most advanced intelligent process automation solutions for the enterprise market. ABBYY's IDP solutions provide not only high-quality text and image recognition, but also a document conversion technology that seamlessly integrate into all major intelligent automation platforms. The platform handles every type of document, from simple forms to complex free-form documents, and every job size, from ad hoc single documents to large batch jobs requiring tough service level agreements (SLAs). This way, ABBYY helps companies gain insight into all the data they hold including both structured information, such as reports, and unstructured information, such as e-mails.

"In every organization, documents are processed on a large scale. If you don’t centralize this information, these actions are repeated in every department, which increases risk while stalling time to value. Our solutions prevent this from happening. They reduce the administrative burden and provide more value allowing for employees concentrate on more complex tasks and projects,” comments Robert Bien, Head of Sales, Benelux and Nordics at ABBYY.

Baptiste Guionnet, Partner, Corporate Finance & CFO Advisory from Deloitte Luxembourg points to the expected efficiencies and control opportunities that ABBYY offers with its finance and accounting modules. “

“Today’s fast-paced business environment requires smooth and reliable processes. With ABBYY, we are able to drive digital transformation by offering our clients accelerated and improved digital workflows. We have been using ABBYY’s IDP solution within the company to automate several administrative tasks such as invoice management—and we are very satisfied with the efficiency gains. By joining forces with ABBYY, we can ensure that our clients are able to benefit from this powerful solution as well.”

According to IDC’s European Intelligent Process Automation Software Forecast, 2020-2024, intelligent process automation revenue in Benelux (comprising Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) will grow at a [CAGR of 16.7% to $737 million in 2019-2024](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=EUR147055020).\[1\]

ABBYY was recognized by Everest Group, a leading consulting and research firm, as a Leader in its IDP products PEAK Matrix® Assessment 2021, as well as a leader in two other analysts firms’ market evaluations, [ISG Provider Lens™ Intelligent Automation - Solutions & Services 2021 – IDP (US)](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) and [Quadrant Knowledge Solutions’ 2021 SPARK Matrix for IDP](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) due to the strong ratings of its comprehensive technology for document processing and no-code IDP platform, ABBYY Vantage. ABBYY was positioned in the Leaders’ category of the comparative assessment among 18 vendors due to its impact in the market and its ability to deliver solutions successfully.
