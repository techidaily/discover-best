## International Day of Families: Conversations with the ABBYY Team

May 15, 2024

Did you know that the International Day of Families is celebrated on the 15th of May every year?

At ABBYY, we value accommodating the diverse needs of our colleagues to ensure that thriving at work does not come at the expense of striking an ideal balance between professional and family life. We do this by providing flexible work arrangements including hybrid work, remote work, work-from-abroad opportunities, and flexible working hours across most of our teams.

From stories of siblings and partners working together to colleagues discovering the joys of parenthood, a few ABBYY colleagues share their stories on balancing work and family life.

### Anastasiia and Anna

First up, we're going to our Ukrainian office where we find sisters **Anastasiia and Anna**: 

"Talking about this feels like uncovering a big secret," says Anastsiia, our US Fulfilment Team Lead, "I have a baby sister working with me at ABBYY!" 

"Let me tell you, having a family member at work with you can be both a blessing and a curse!

On the bright side, I've got a built-in support system (sometimes in a quite literal sense, since she works in one of ABBYY's support teams!): she's the one to commiserate with about the work challenges, the one to be a lunch buddy, someone to cover for me if I need a quick break, and, of course, a guaranteed ally in navigating any office situation. 

While we may not always find the perfect balance, at the end of the day, the most important part is that we navigate the ups and downs together! 

Plus, when our schedules align , we can always sneak in some sibling bonding time, which is quite a bonus, if you ask me.” 

“It was my sister's experience at ABBYY that led me to join the team." says her sister, Anna, who is one of our Customer Support Experts. She shares how having her sister work alongside her has many positive sides. 

"I have a constant source of support and someone to bounce ideas off. When I joined, integration was easy as I already had an idea about the company and there was someone to help me navigate the learning curve. She shares insights into her field of work, and in turn, I share my expertise from my area of work. Solving urgent issues can be easier and more efficient due to the ease of our communication and collaboration!"

Going the extra mile is common at ABBYY, and Anna’s sister goes above and beyond, so when she asked us to leave a heartfelt note to her sister hidden in the text of this article, we couldn't say no.

"Dear sis, I know you're checking this out. I just wanted to say thank you. I know I can always count on you ...even if it means I keep you up late sometimes."

While we may not always find the perfect balance, at the end of the day, the most important part is that we navigate the ups and downs together!

Anastasiia, US Fulfillment Team Lead

### Ryan

From Ukraine, we go to Singapore, and from siblings, we chat with parents, specifically with our Senior Solution Consultant and mother of two, **Ryan**, who tells us that balancing parenthood and work is a true balancing act. 

"Kids consistently require a lot of my energy and attention when they are back from school. And I’m not exaggerating when I say that I can hear my children call ‘mom/mama!’ at least 50 times a day. For me to respond with good energy it is key that I prioritize maintaining a good work-life balance." 

"Having the flexibility to work remotely allows me to spend more quality time with the kids," she shared while acknowledging a common, but little-spoken-about feeling among working parents, the guilt of not spending enough quality time with your children when navigating work commitments. 

For me to respond with good energy, it is key that I prioritize maintaining a good work-life balance.

**Steve**, our Head of Talent Acquisition based in the US, shares Ryan's view that once you become a parent, striking the perfect work-life balance takes center stage.

“For me, work-life balance has always been a priority. Since becoming a parent, however, it has become both more important and a challenge to balance the two. One thing that has become abundantly clear to me is how fast time goes by once you’re a parent, which has really put things into perspective in terms of what matters most when prioritizing one’s time. After having my first child, I found myself seeking greater flexibility in my career to accommodate these new responsibilities. Working remotely allows that flexibility to not only have more time but also allows you to choose how that time is spent. It has been a game changer for me and my family in the best of ways.

“Parenthood can also deepen one's appreciation for the importance of quality of time spent with loved ones and the need to establish boundaries to maintain a healthy balance between work and personal life. The perspective changed in consideration of the overall impact you create with your time.”

"At first, I thought that becoming a parent will maybe have, so to say, a negative impact on my work and career," confessed **Aleksandar** from our Finance team in Serbia who has recently joined ABBYY after becoming a father. 

"In my case, children were the biggest motivation and one of the main reasons that led me to make a change in my professional career and find a role outside of the industry I was working in. They were also the main reason to get out of my comfort zone and, to seek new opportunities and challenges.

At ABBYY, I found my first role where I could work remotely. Initially, my biggest concern was how to organize my time and find a balance between my kids' needs and work commitments, I now feel like I found a "winning combination" here.

### Konstantin and Ekaterina

In our Cyprus Research Development (R&D) and Product Development teams, we found **Konstantin** and **Ekaterina** who shared a bit about their experience working as a married couple with children at ABBYY:

“Truth be told, ABBYY isn't our first rodeo together. We hustled as waiters back in our student days, then rocked it out at another IT joint.

Working side by side means we can easily team up on projects that blend QA and DevOps. We brainstorm solutions together, tackle issues in real time, and cheer on our wins together.

Yeah, we chat about work at home sometimes, but we make sure to switch it off, too. It's all about finding that balance.

Working together has strengthened our professional bond and given us fresh perspectives on our work. It's a journey full of highs, a few bumps, and lots of laughs. Maintaining a clear boundary between work and personal life is the secret here."

### Rahul

![rahul-600x600](https://content.abbyy.com/-/media/project/abbyy/abbyy/insights/blog/international-day-of-families/rahul-600x600.png) 

When asked about how working remotely impacted his family dynamics compared to working in a traditional office setting, **Rahul**, Partner Innovation and Enablement Consultant, who you might remember from our [heartwarming Valentine's Day story](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abbyy%5Flifeatabbyy-abbyy-valentinesday-activity-7163133907616395264-uMgS), told us that flexible working arrangements have been a game-changer for his family.

"The big win? No more commuting. This means we get more time together as a family—time we can spend on fun activities, sharing meals, or just being there for each other.," he told us.

"What's more, being able to set our own schedules helps us sync up better with each other's day. My spouse and I can now easily coordinate our work and downtime, making room for shared hobbies and experiences that we just couldn't squeeze in with a 9-to-5 office job. 

One of the biggest pluses, though, has been the ability to look after my parents. Knowing I can be there for them, whether it’s an emergency or just the daily routine, really puts my mind at ease and brings us closer together.

Overall, while working from home means we need to be disciplined about our work and personal lives, it’s been a fantastic way to strengthen our family bonds. It's not just about being physically present—it's about being more connected and involved."
