### 5\. Fastreel —Edit MOV Files Online

![Fastreel Free Edit MOV Online](https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/free-mov-editor/free-mov-editor-05.webp)

It offers built-in templates, so you can edit videos with those templates or via online tools. But the free version only results in low quality video limited to 480p. If you want to remove the watermark and get high-quality video content, you can pay for the single-premium or unlimited premium.

**Pros:**

* Straightforward to use
* A set of templates to choose

**Cons:**

* Free-version offers limited capabilities and have watermarks
* Can’t call a support agent
