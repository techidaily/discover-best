#### _The enhanced partnership will consolidate and grow ABBYY’s market footprints in the UK and Ireland_

ABBYY® a global leader in content IQ technologies and solutions, has announced an expanded distribution partnership with Sigma Software Distribution, which will see Sigma distribute a range of ABBYY products to markets in the UK and Ireland.

Effective from May 1, 2019, the expanded agreement grants Sigma with extended rights to distribute ABBYY’s lineup of software applications and solutions for personal productivity and document digitization and conversion, including ABBYY FineReader and FineReader Server to customers and users throughout the UK and Ireland.

**Kristin Wagener, Senior Director Global Application Software Sales at ABBYY**, said: “With its extensive customer base, deep technical expertise and market knowledge, Sigma gives us a market reach which will help grow our business across the UK and Ireland. Sigma already represents ABBYY in this region and we are pleased to extend our partnership.”
