### 5\. Fastreel —Edit MOV Files Online

![Fastreel Free Edit MOV Online](https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/free-mov-editor/free-mov-editor-05.webp)

**Pros:**

* Straightforward to use
* A set of templates to choose

**Cons:**

* Free-version offers limited capabilities and have watermarks
* Can’t call a support agent
