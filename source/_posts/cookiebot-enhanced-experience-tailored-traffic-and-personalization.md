_Leading bank modernises the processing of its credit applications and inheritance documents_

[ABBYY](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), a leading provider of document recognition, data capture, and linguistic technologies, today announced that Banque Populaire de l’Ouest, a member of France’s second largest banking group – Banque Populaire Caisses d’Épargne (BPCE) – has successfully overhauled two strategic document-based processes thanks to ADOC Solutions, an ABBYY Gold Certified Solution Partner. 

The inheritance and credit departments at Banque Populaire de l’Ouest manage thousands of cases per year and deal with a wide variety of document types. The documents arrive through multiple channels including post and email. To help get a handle on these complex processes Banque Populaire de l’Ouest turned to ADOC Solutions, an ABBYY solution partner and an expert in document management solutions. ADOC Solutions was initially selected as a service provider by the Caisse d’Épargne Bretagne Pays de Loire (CEBPL), member of the BPCE group, for whom they developed a [document digitisation solution](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) in 2012.

"_The success of the project for CEBPL was an important factor for Banque Populaire de l’Ouest in choosing ADOC Solutions for its digitisation project in its inheritance and credit departments. The goal was to facilitate access to information for all employees and eliminate the manual circulation of paper documents,_" says Jean-Sébastien Wagner, general director at ADOC Solutions.

To power the solution, they chose a digital mailroom solution for automation needs of customer oriented businesses. It is a feature-rich solution that digitises, intelligently classifies and quickly routes content throughout an organisation.

"_ABBYY offers a wide range of products which help banks and other organisations of different sizes to manage considerable volumes of documents, as well as process and understand their content,_" indicates Gregory Laborderie, commercial director at ABBYY France. "_Thanks to our solutions, we can respond to customer needs in the digital world._"

Prior to implementing the solution the bank received all documents in paper form and distributed and processed them manually. Now all document handling takes place automatically – the incoming documents can be easily digitised and classified. Then, based on the classified information, the documents are allocated to the employee in charge. The solution was easily implemented and customised according to the needs and requirements of the bank. The teams mastered it quickly due to its ease of use, practicality, improvement of customer responsiveness and simplicity in circulating documents.
