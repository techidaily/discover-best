### How to Merge DVD Titles into a Single One

**Step 1:** Free download MacX DVD Ripper Pro on your MacBook/MBP/iMac/iMac Pro or Windows PC. Afterwards, launch it.

**Step 2:** Add your DVD source. After you import the DVD source, this DVD copy software will automatically read and detect your DVD disc. Afterwards, it scans your DVD title and then auto select the correct main title without any 3rd party applications. The whole process will be completed within 3 seconds.

**Step 3:** Choose the output format or device profile from the pop-up window and enable "Merge titles". 

Tip 1: if what you load is the TV series DVD, just tick the episode titles, enable **"Merge titles"** and choose an output format, be it digital format, ISO image (zero transcoding), MPEG-2 or mobile devices like iPhone iPad, Apple TV, Android, Microsoft, Sony, game consoles.

Tip 2: Cut and Crop: You can also enable the movie editing feature which allows you to [cut off unwanted DVD movie](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), crop out the black bars to enable full-screen playback on the device.

Tip 3: in case the movie titles you wanna merge are located at 3 discs (part 1, part 2 and special features), you're required to rip a DVD on Mac one at a time. Afterwards, select the same output format and make sure that each output file shares the identical parameters, like keeping the same frame rate as 23.97fps, 25fps, 29.97fps or 30fps via Settings option at the DVD video info zone. Lastly, when each DVD rip is finished, then resort to a [video converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to import all the DVD output files to the converter. Then tap "Merge" icon to merge DVD digital clips into one file.

![choose output format](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-ripper-pro/../mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/drp-review-rip-dvd.jpg)

**Step 4:** Opt for the audio and subtitle tracks. The default setting of subtitle is "Disabled Subtitle" and that of audio track is usually the "AC3 \[English\] 6ch" for Hollywood DVD disc. Hence, if you plan to rip DVD with forced subtitle or soft/hard subtitle, you're supposed to manually choose the subtitle tracks at the main title info bar. The same also applies to audio track selection.

\[Optionally\] Take best use of your CPU core utilities and check the Hardware encoder (Intel/AMD/Nvidia) if the DVD ripping speed is at the top of your priority list. The application of the Hardware Encoder can guarantee you a smooth DVD ripping procedure to avoid [DVD ripping errors](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) like DVD ripper hangs/freezes at 8%, DVD ripping gets stuck, etc. Besides, tick "De-interlacing" and "Use High Quality Engine" if output quality is uppermost in your mind.

**Step 5:** Click "Browse" button to select the target folder to save the output merged files. Then hit "RUN" button to begin to rip and merge DVD titles on Mac/Windows without further ado. When the DVD ripping and merging are accomplished, open it to see if it has video audio seamlessly synced and the entire video is clearly displayed.
