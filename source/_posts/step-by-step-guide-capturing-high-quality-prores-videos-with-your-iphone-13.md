[Apple ProRes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple%5FProRes) is a high quality, lossy video compression formar developed by Apple Inc. for use in post-production that supports video resolution up to 8K. ProRes is a line of intermediate codecs, which means they are intended for use during video editing instead of user viewing. It's initially introduced in 2007 with Final Cut Studio 2, and it's widely used in Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve and so on. Recently ProRes is available to be recorded on iPhone 13 Pro (Max).

Moreover, ProRes is not a singular thing, though. It’s a family of six quality standards, from the space-saving 'ProRes 422 Proxy' right up to the ultra-high-quality 'ProRes 4444 XQ'. Here are the details about ProRes quality standards:

## Part 3: FAQs

Even though you get to know what is ProRes, you may still be confused with more ProRes issues. Here, we'd like to answer the frequently asked ProRes questions. 

**1\. Why iPhone 13 Pro doesn't support ProRes 4K video in 128GB?** 

You know 4K video could take a huge size on your iPhone, but you may not know that the ProRes 4K could make it worse. One hour of RAW 4K content requires close to 110GB of storage; approximately 2GB per minute. Obviously, 128GB iPhone 13 Pro is not big enough for you to shoot 4K ProRes videos at will. 

**2\. What cameras can record ProRes raw?**

As ProRes RAW goes, an increasingly growing of cameras support to record ProRes Raw footage, such as DJI Zenmuse X7, Atomos NEON 17/ 24/ 31/ 55, NINJA V, SUMO 19, SHOGUN INFERNO, SHOGUN 7 and so on. 

**3\. Can QuickTime play ProRes files?**

Yes. After you [install Pro Video Formats](https://support.apple.com/guide/final-cut-pro/download-sound-effects-and-pro-video-formats-ver927c79852/mac) on your Mac, you can view ProRes RAW files with QuickTime Player. And QuickTime Player on the Windows OS can offer real time playback of Apple ProRes files. 

**4\. Is ProRes better than H.264?**

Yes, ProRes is virtually lossless, and is specifically designed for this purpose. H.264 is highly compressed and not designed for editing. 

**5\. Is ProRes raw HDR?**

ProRes RAW is based on the same principles and underlying technology as existing Apple ProRes codecs, and is ideal for High Dynamic Range (HDR) content creation in Final Cut Pro, Motion, and Compressor.
