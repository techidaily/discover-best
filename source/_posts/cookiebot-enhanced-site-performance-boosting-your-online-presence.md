[ABBYY, a leader in intelligent automation](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), and management consulting firm Doculabs have announced they formed a strategic partnership to help their clients experience a faster and more impactful intelligent automation journey.

Doculabs has selected [ABBYY Timeline](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), a leader in process mining [according to Gartner](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), for its intuitive ‘no-code’ analysis tools that allow less technical users to install speedier implementations while offering robust power for processing a wider range of workflows and ad hoc business processes. With Timeline’s more rapid and deeper insights, Doculabs can deliver a better customer experience, automate operations, and identify the best technologies to reduce costs and empower customers to maximize their people’s potential.

Furthermore, Doculabs will construct its own pre-built, best-practices based solutions on the ABBYY Timeline platform, giving them and their clients more extensive analysis and simulation capabilities than any other competing process mining solutions. 

"Doculabs has significant experience in extending the capabilities of process mining across an enterprise at an accelerated pace. ABBYY Timeline allows us to address a broad range of use cases, particularly ad hoc processes with long-running cases such as customer service, claims, disputes, and fraud investigations.   
  
We needed a cost-effective solution that can provide clients with a faster return on investment. In addition, with ABBYY’s OEM relationship with SS&C, we are able to quickly serve our existing Blue Prism users as well as the thousands of other Blue Prism customers needing specialized process and task mining skills."

_James Watson PhD, Founder and CEO, Doculabs_

ABBYY Timeline will be a critical component of Doculabs’ [Process Mining IQ](https://www.doculabs.com/post/introducing-process-mining-iq-a-game-changer-for-process-mining-enthusiasts) initiative whose goal is to accelerate the adoption of process mining across clients’ organizations. The Process Mining IQ knowledge center establishes Doculabs as a trusted resource to engage with practitioners, collaborate with peers, gain access to a library of assets, participate in live training, events, and reserve time with teaching assistants.

"Doculabs’ extensive knowledge and experience in process mining and analysis make them a perfect partner for the power and flexibility of the Timeline process intelligence platform.   
  
By partnering with Doculabs, our customers will be able to go far beyond what was possible with more limited process mining technologies to deliver solutions based on a comprehensive platform for process and task mining, analysis, monitoring, prediction and simulation."

_Scott Opitz, Chief Technology Officer, ABBYY_
